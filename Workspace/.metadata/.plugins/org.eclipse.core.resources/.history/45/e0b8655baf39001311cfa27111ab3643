/* Write a thread safe data structure such that there could be only one writer 
 * at a time but there could be n readers reading the data. 
 * You can consider that incrementing or decrementing a variable is an atomic operation.
 * If more than one threads try to write simultaneously then just select one randomly and let others wait
 * 
 * A readers-writer lock is like a mutex, in that it controls access to a shared resource, 
 * allowing concurrent access to multiple threads for reading but restricting access to a single thread for writes 
 * (or other changes) to the resource. 
 * A common use might be to control access to a data structure in memory that can't be updated atomically and 
 * isn't valid (and shouldn't be read by another thread) until the update is complete.
